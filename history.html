          <h1>A Brief History of K-Pop</h1>
          <p>K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop; Hangul: 케이팝) is a music genre
            originating in South Korea that is characterized by a wide variety
            of audiovisual elements. Although it includes all genres of "popular
            music" within South Korea, the term is often used in a narrower
            sense to describe a modern form of South Korean pop music drawing
            inspiration on a range of styles and genres incorporated from the
            rest of the world such as Western pop music, rock, experimental,
            jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, R&amp;B, reggae, electronic dance, folk,
            country and classical on top of its uniquely traditional Korean
            music roots. The more modern form of the genre emerged with one
            of the earliest K-pop groups, Seo Taiji and Boys, forming in 1992.
            Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and
            integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize
            South Korea's contemporary music scene.</p>

            <p>Modern K-pop "idol" culture began with the boy band H.O.T. in 1996,
            as K-pop grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of
            teenagers and young adults. After a slump in early K-pop, TVXQ
            and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music
            genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to
            popularize K-pop internationally today. With the advent of
            online social networking services and Korean TV shows, the current
            global spread of K-pop and Korean entertainment known as the Korean
            Wave is seen not only in East and Southeast Asia, but also Latin
            America, India, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Western
            world, gaining a widespread global audience.</p>
